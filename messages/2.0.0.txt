Hello, welcome to the new version of the Purescript sublime package!
Since 2.0.0, the Purescript package is combined with Purescript IDE,
which integrates pse-ide into the editor to provide functions such
as auto-complete, type-hints, rebuild and error report.

This package automatically searches for the `purs` binary in your PATH
and execute it. You can also customise the binary path in preference.
